#HEYDAYHACKCARD

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a hack club card that has my favorite game on it; Hayday. The card will light up when tapped to electronics. it will also promote my
favorite teacher and our inside joke of him becoming president.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
the card will cost about $20.58 
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
the card design process was super challenging at first. I kept facing issues with the routing and the coustom part. 
Also, finding the parts was challenging. I also faced issues with the images I imported for the design. The design would come out super dark or 
super faded. Overall it was really fun to know that I created and designed something for myself.
